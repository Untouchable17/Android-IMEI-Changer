<h2 align="center">A little explanation of the code and a teaser</h2>

<p>Changing the <b>IMEI</b> (<b>International Mobile Equipment Identity</b>) is illegal in many countries, including the US, Canada, the UK and the EU.</p>

<p>In general, changing the IMEI may violate laws related to consumer protection and/or communications and may lead to legal consequences. In addition, changing the IMEI can cause problems with the operation of the device, as it can lead to the blocking of the device by the network or to incompatibility with software and updates.</p>

<p>The ban on changing the IMEI is due to the fact that the IMEI is used to identify a mobile device in a mobile network. Each device has a unique IMEI that serves to identify and track the device on the network. Changing the IMEI can be due to illegal activities, such as theft or fraud, where a device with a modified IMEI can be sold or used for unauthorized access to the network. In some countries, changing the IMEI is a crime and may be punishable by law.</p>
